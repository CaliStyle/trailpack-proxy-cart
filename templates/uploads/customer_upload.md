# Product CSV file format
The first line of your customer CSV has to include the field headers described below with each separated by a comma. Subsequent lines in the file should contain data for your customer using those same fields in that exact same order. Here's a description of each field:

## First Name
## Last Name
## Tags (can be left blank)
Comma-separated list of tags used to tag the product. Most spreadsheet applications automatically add quotes around the tags for you. If you are using a plain text editor, you will need to manually add the quote. For example, `tag1, tag2, tag3`.
